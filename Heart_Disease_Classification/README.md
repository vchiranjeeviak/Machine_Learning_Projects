In this project, we intended to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not given some medical details.

The dataset we used in this project is from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

We applied some machine learning techniques on the available data and make predictions on the new data.

In this project, we first cleaned the data, studied the data using univariate and bivariate analysis.

We also used corelation matrix to find the importance of each feature in determining whether the person has heart disease or not.

Since this is a classification problem, we used three basic classification algorithms:
                
                        1. Logistic Regression.
                        2. K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier.
                        3. Random Forest Classifier.
                        
Then, we tuned the hyper-parameters using Randomized search and Grid search.

Finally, we acheived at a relatively optimised model for our data.
